## 2023 Advent of Code

Welcome to my part of the repository that I made the [Advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2023) 
from the year 2023, if you would like to know more about adventofcode

This year I would like to try something different, and a programming
language that I usually don't use, and starting learning.

So I decided to the "AWK" programming language, for more information
click [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK), but the definition from wikipedia is:

```
    AWK is a domain-specific language designed for text processing and 
    typically used as a data extraction and reporting tool. Like sed and 
    grep, it is a filter, and is a standard feature of most Unix-like 
    operating systems.
```

The Paradigms of this programming language are:

- Scripting
    
- Preocedural

- data-driven
